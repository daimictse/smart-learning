Title of the App: Easy Cursive and Color

Hackbright final project: an iOS app for kids to learn cursive writing, plus a mini-game on color mixing

App uses Python, Flask, Xcode, Objective-C, Bezier path and $P gesture recognizer API.

Ideal paths are define for each lowercase and uppercase of each of the 26 alphabets. As user traces the alphabet(s), the app creates a bezier path. After the 'Done' button is hit, the app create 2 bitmaps images from the ideal path and bezier path, and compare each bytes on the images to calculate a score.  Scores will be kept if user log in with a name and a password.

The mini-game of color mixing has a set of basic colors.  A matrix with the correct color combinations is used to compare the result.
